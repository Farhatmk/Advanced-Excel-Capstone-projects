Project 1 Depreciation Calculator

Depreciation Calculator
Overview
This project is an Excel-based Depreciation Calculator that helps users calculate asset depreciation using two common methods:

Straight-Line Method
Diminishing Balance Method
The calculator provides a structured approach to computing depreciation over an asset's lifespan, considering additional costs, scrap values, and estimated life spans.

Features
Straight-Line Method: Calculates equal yearly depreciation based on the total asset cost and lifespan.
Diminishing Balance Method: Applies a percentage-based depreciation, reducing the asset value each year dynamically.
Depreciation Schedule: Displays a breakdown of yearly depreciation and remaining book value.
Accuracy Checks: Ensures that scrap value is considered correctly in both methods.
Usage
Users can input values for:

Asset Cost
Additional Costs
Scrap Value
Estimated Life Span
The Excel sheet then automatically computes yearly depreciation and displays the final book value of the asset.

Future Enhancements
Add support for more depreciation methods.
Convert the Excel logic into a web-based or Python-based tool.
Provide graphical representations for better data visualization.
